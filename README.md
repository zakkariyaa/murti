<h2>How it's made:</h2>
<p><b>Tech used:</b> React, styled-components, Nodejs, Expressjs, Cheerio, Restful API</p>
<p>Reactjs is used on the frontend for displaying data and state management, Styled Components
<br>to style the web pages, and Nodejs/Express API to handle data on the backend.
<br>The API scrapes the data from puplic website using Cheerio.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h2>Optimatizations:</h2>
<p><i>(Optional)</i></p>
<p>It may take couple seconds for the first time to load the data and be displayed on the screen.
<br>We can use react useContext hook and session storage to store a cache
<br>of the first page on the users browser, so second time they visit it loads faster.</p>
<p>We can also give the pages a better look with CSS.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>I have learnt a lot from this project. Making my own API - a web scraping one at that - 
<br>for the fronted to use was the biggest challenge. I have also consildated my understanding of 
<br>useState react hook.</p>
